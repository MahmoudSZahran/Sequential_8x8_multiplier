# Sequential_8x8_multiplier
/ The Sequential 8x8 Multiplier is a Verilog design that implements an 8x8 bit multiplier using a sequential approach. This project aims to provide an efficient and modular solution for performing multiplication operations on 8-bit operands, resulting in a 16-bit product. The design supports various features, including multi-cycle computation, output signaling, and efficient pin utilization./

The project's goal is to build an 8x8 multiplier that takes two 8-bit multiplicands (dataa and datab) as inputs and produces a 16-bit product (product8x8_out). Additionally, the design provides a done flag (done_flag) and seven signals (seg_a, seg_b, seg_c, seg_d, seg_e, seg_f, and seg_g) to drive a 7-segment display. The multiplier operates in a multi-cycle fashion, requiring four clock cycles to complete the full multiplication.
